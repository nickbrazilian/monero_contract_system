#   Monero Contract System

## Project Goal
This project aims to create an open-source web application that allows users to host their own arbitration/escrow platform. Users can specify requirements (e.g., "I want a website built like this in 3 days"), deposit funds into escrow, release funds upon task completion, or contact the website administrator for arbitration if disputes arise.

## FAQ
1. **Do I have to trust the website administrator?**  
   Yes, you must trust the website administrator to act fairly in arbitration decisions.

2. **Can the system be decentralized without trusting a website owner?**  
   Yes! A future solution (planned in Rust) will mimic Bisq (a decentralized Bitcoin exchange), using AI for arbitration and a fallback "blockchain judicial system" for disputes. This MVP exists as a quick resume project, but the decentralized version is a long-term goal.
